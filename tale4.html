<h1>Tale 2:</h1>
<h1>Tall Arms</h1>
<p>
<strong>Tall Arms</strong> is a Saint Hallowian urban legend that began to spread sometime during 2010. The legend states that an extremely tall humanoid figure can be spotted roaming through public property (parks, roads) or private property (farms, lawns) notably with its arms raised high and very straight, during the hours of 1:31 - 5:51 AM. 
</p>
<p>
If confronted, the figure will sprint at the confronter, and violently maul their face, and carry their dead body back to their house on its arms, And dumping the body back in the confronter’s bed. Notably with the victim’s arms being severely but not entirely detached from their body. 
</p>
<p>
The legend originally began due to a leaked police report of a case involving ‘a figure stretching its arms in a field’ that was believed to have been a fabricated police call, as the report says that police ‘did not find any evidence that anyone trespassed.’ Since the 1991 to 2005 period that the legend began, numerous sightings of Tall Arms have been reported, but none can officially have been reported.

<h1>History</h1>  
  <p>On July 12th, estimated 1991 to 2005, at 2:42 AM, the Saint Hallow Police Department (SHPD) received a letter stating that a tall figure had been trespassing on the property of the ‘Millers.’ Who were apparently the owners of the now abandoned Little Field Corn Patch. The letter contained this message:</p>
<p>
  Dear SHPD.

For the past month, I have been seeing a figure in the middle of my cornfield, 321 HAW Miller Corn Patch. I don’t know what he is even doing, just standing in the middle or some random place just sticking his arms up. He usually comes at around 2 - 3 am. If I could please get officer assistance, that would be great. 

-Millers.
