<h1>Tale 2:</h1>
<h1>Tall Arms</h1>
<p>
<strong>Tall Arms</strong> is a Saint Hallowian urban legend that began to spread sometime during 2010. The legend states that an extremely tall humanoid figure can be spotted roaming through public property (parks, roads) or private property (farms, lawns) notably with its arms raised high and very straight, during the hours of 1:31 - 5:51 AM. 
</p>
<p>
If confronted, the figure will sprint at the confronter, and violently maul their face, and carry their dead body back to their house on its arms, And dumping the body back in the confronter’s bed. Notably with the victim’s arms being severely but not entirely detached from their body. 
</p>
<p>
The legend originally began due to a leaked police report of a case involving ‘a figure stretching its arms in a field’ that was believed to have been a fabricated police call, as the report says that police ‘did not find any evidence that anyone trespassed.’ Since the 1991 to 2005 period that the legend began, numerous sightings of Tall Arms have been reported, but none can officially have been reported.

<h1>History</h1>  
  <p>On July 12th, estimated 1991 to 2005, at 2:42 AM, the Saint Hallow Police Department (SHPD) received a letter stating that a tall figure had been trespassing on the property of the ‘Millers.’ Who were apparently the owners of the now abandoned Little Field Corn Patch. The letter contained this message:</p>
<p>
  Dear SHPD.

For the past month, I have been seeing a figure in the middle of my cornfield, 321 HAW Miller Corn Patch. I don’t know what he is even doing, just standing in the middle or some random place just sticking his arms up. He usually comes at around 2 - 3 am. If I could please get officer assistance, that would be great. 

-Millers.

</p>
  <p>Upon arrival at the Miller Corn Patch, police discovered that the property was abandoned, the cottage located at the head of the corn patch was unoccupied and was near collapse. There also wasn’t any evidence that the corn patch had even been walked through. Police concluded the letter was a prank, but for the next three years, the police would get similar anonymous reports claiming Tall Arms appeared on properties that were abandoned, or not privately owned, although had no evidence that anyone had even been there. 

Eventually, around 2006 - 2010, during a cyberattack, archived reports of ‘Tall Arms’ incidents began to spread, most notably through WikiLeaks and Hallow Reports, which is considered how the legend began to rapidly spread. 

On October 29th 2019, the body of Eric Gane was found dead in his home with his body in the condition that was similar to how Tall Arms leaves its victims. His body was on his bed, and his arms were broken and haphazardly detached from his body. Gane’s death caused the Tall Arms legend to regain popularity, causing mass hysteria, which caused SHPD to implement curfews to search for Gane’s murderer. Although this was lifted in 2021 after the case was officially closed.
