<h1>Tale 3:</h1>
<p>
“He looks like he is crucified to the wall.” The man said. “It’s temporary, only until we find a way to kill him.” The other one said. “He is like a vampire, you need a stake to his heart to kill him, although we don’t know where the heart nor the stake is.” The man calmly replied, not so clearly annoyed. Around the room the two men loitered in, a bunch of shelves that held various items like paint buckets, shotgun shells, chains, wires, even computers. All hugged the walls in order for the room to have as much open space as possible, a tiny lightbulb somehow illuminating it. The two men, wearing boiler suits, one holding more chains and restraints that they didn’t think were necessary stared at the wall. Both nervous, but still shockingly confident. “It’ll work for now.” One of them said.
 
He opened his black eyes, quickly closing one while leaving the other one’s lid creaked open a little bit, enough to have a blurry picture of two humans clogged his dark red pupil, one holding chains that he recognized were the ones he could feel the cold sensation on his wrists. Without getting their attention, he pieced together that he was captured, both of his arms were restrained to something cutting through his wrists, unpleasant but not painful, he was raised off the ground, making him wonder how they succeeded at that. “Alright, let’s go.” The one who wasn’t holding the chains said. The one who eyed him down one more time, before following their friend and gently closing the door. Now alone, he got a more clear view of the room he was imprisoned in. Quickly turning his head to his right and left, his predictions were correct. After waiting a few minutes he swiftly pulled the restraints off and fell to the ground, he was very rusty, and momentarily lost control of his limbs, but the feeling quickly subdued. Before he rose and stood tall again. His eyes locking onto the door the humans fled into.
