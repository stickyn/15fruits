<h1>Tale 1:</h1>
<p>
“Can I sit here?” Speake looked up, a woman in her twenties contacted his eyes, she had a stern yet concerned expression on her face. “Yeah, of course.” Speake simply replied. The woman had something, uncanny about her. Her eyes were a lot ‘bigger’ than usual, something Speake kept in the back of his brain, albeit still in his reach. “Do you know about the hotel?” The woman asked. Speake assumed she meant the one twenty minutes up the road, a ‘young’ hotel to Speake’s standards, early 2000’s. “Kavla?” 
“Yes. I have a request. For say.” The woman responded. Speake looked at her curiously. “In the basement of the hotel, there is something that, belongs to me.” The woman said. “My face isn’t welcome around there, I have done some things that I shouldn’t have done, according to them at least.” Speake eyed her. A very strange request. “You think I’ll do that? You’re ridiculous.” Speake firmly replied. The woman’s expression changed from neutral, to a hybrid combination of disappointed but happy. “I figured.” She responded. She then got up and began walking towards the elevator, before briefly stopping and speedwalking back. And slamming against the table, surprising Speake. “You will. Okay? I expect it done, by next week.” Her eyes, or lids, were a lot bigger now, and suddenly her eyes when from a grey pupil on white eyes, to an entirely black eye, with clear white pupils, they nearly glowed. Speake felt weird, he wasn’t going to do it, but then he felt like he was. Because he is going to. The woman then slowly walked back towards the elevator and got inside. And smiled as Speake saw the doors close.
